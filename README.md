# bukkit-death-location
A Bukkit/Spigot plugin that shows player location in the death message

## Building/installation
- Get Maven (required only for building the jar file â€“ not necessary on the Minecraft server)
- Run `mvn package` in the root of this project
- Maven creates a `target` folder. There you should find `DeathLocation.jar` file. Copy that to the `plugins` folder in your Bukkit/Spigot server
- Run the server and it should work
